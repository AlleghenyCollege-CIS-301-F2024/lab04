## Part 1. Questions from Part 1

+ 1.1 Describe this dataset; What types of data does it contain?

``` text
TODO
```

+ 1.2 Name two types of questions that you could expect to answer using this dataset.

``` text
TODO
```

+ 4.1. What kind of data is contained in the created `rate` column?

``` text
TODO
```

+ 4.2. In terms of its informational content, how could this column be useful in an analysis?

``` text
TODO
```

+ 6.1 Describe this plot; What information does it contain? Is there any evidence of a pattern that you see? Explain.

``` text
TODO
```

+ 6.2 What is significant about the red vertical line? (You may have to go online to search for this answer.)

``` text
TODO
```

+ 8.1 In clear and meaningful language, interrupt your results from the plot.

``` text
TODO
```
  
+ 8.2 Compare the plot from the dataset  `dat_caliFocus` to the plot from the dataset `dat_measles_rate_lessTwoStates`. Could California be used to represent the rest of the country in terms of general and similar patterns? Why or why not? What are these patterns?

``` text
TODO
```

+ 8.3 Describe what both of these plots are showing. Why do you suppose the analysis that you have just completed so revolutionary in medical science?

``` text
TODO
```

+ 10.1 Describe the resulting plot.

``` text
TODO
```

+ 10.2 Applying a square-root function to data points is called a transformation. What is the difference between the plots using the transformation to those that do not use the transformation for the same years?

``` text

```

+ 11.1 Enter the below code and offer an interpretation of the resulting plot.

## Part 2. Writing About Ethics

Please write in clear and meaningful language.

+ What type(s) of damage may happen to public medicine and /or public opinion from misinformation? What is an example from the article?

``` text
TODO
```

+ What should be the role of academic groups that publish or push research to prevent misinformation?

``` text
TODO
```

+ Researchers associated with misinformed papers tend to retract their names from these articles. This likely means that the researchers (and their organizations) no longer support the content of the article. After the damage was committed from Wakefield’s paper, can retracting one’s name from a paper (or retracting the paper itself) be enough to fix this damage? How could the damage be fixed, in your opinion?
